# ACFAParamEditor
FULLY WORKING NOW
It needs a lot of improvements so I'm not ready to release it yet  
You can however build it yourself

# Building
If you want to build the project you should clone it with this command in git bash:  
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WarpZephyr/ACFAParamEditor.git  
```
Then build it in visual studio
