# ACFAParamEditor
Currently reads Params and allows you to see what's inside  
Editing has not been implemented yet  
If you edit a cell or row changes will disappear upon changing params or rows

# Building
Currently if you want to build the project you should clone it with this command in git bash:  
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WarpZephyr/ACFAParamEditor.git  
```
Then build it in visual studio
